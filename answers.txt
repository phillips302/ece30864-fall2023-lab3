a. In a non-Agile project, the product owner is the person that sets the
   direction for the team. They handle release management as well as manage
   the stakeholders. They are crucial to the success of the team by acting
   as a leader and by overseeing the entire project process.
   
b. The scrum master differs from the product owner as they handle all scrum
   related tasks, including JIRA tooling and facilitaing sprints and meetings,
   whereas the product owner oversees the whole operation, including visions
   outside of the scrum. They are related in that they keep the team oriented
   towards a certain direction, but differ in the roles they fill in that vision.
