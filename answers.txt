a. In a non-Agile project, the product owner is the person that sets the
   direction for the team. They handle release management as well as manage
   the stakeholders. They are crucial to the success of the team by acting
   as a leader and by overseeing the entire project process.

b. The scrum master differs from the product owner as they handle all scrum
   related tasks, including JIRA tooling and facilitaing sprints and meetings,
   whereas the product owner oversees the whole operation, including visions
   outside of the scrum. They are related in that they keep the team oriented
   towards a certain direction, but differ in the roles they fill in that vision.

c. The three types of meetings that happen during a sprint cycle are:
   1. Sprint Planning Meeting
      ~ Determine what needs to be completed by the sprint (end goal)
      ~ Determines the story points and assigns the stories to the team
   2. Daily Scrum/Standup Meeting
      ~ Short meetings that happen daily (~10 min)
      ~ Discuss work completed, plan work for the upcoming day
   3. Spring Retrospective Meeting
      ~ Discuss work complete and move incomplete work to the backlog
      ~ Close out the sprint and clean up

d. JIRA Terms
   1. EPIC
      ~ Outlines a large body of work that needs to be broken down into many other
        smaller tasks.
      ~ Large goal in the overall project vision
   2. STORY
      ~ Requirement of a larger task that needs to be completed and can be explained
        in a few short sentences.
      ~ Smaller body of work that fits into a larger vision
   3. BUG
      ~ Type of issue that indicates some bottleneck or issue within the larger project
      ~ The smallest unit of work in a sprint
   4. TASK
      ~ Smaller body of work that fits into a larger vision of a project
